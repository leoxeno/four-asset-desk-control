# Rules: pass conditions for every answer

Instructions, not state. Load after `identity.md`, before computing anything. Each rule is stated once. The conventions they point to live in `reference/methodology.md` and are not repeated here.

## What must be true of every number?

1. It was computed by code that reads `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` directly, or rows copied from it verbatim. Never retype a price from memory, and never type a result from memory.
2. It follows the methodology section for that quantity. The README's section table says which one. The section number appears in the answer line.
3. Its inputs are stated: the columns used and the first and last row dates used.
4. It is rounded as methodology section 10 says, with its unit.

## What if the question sets its own terms?

5. If the question names a period, a weighting or a rebalancing rule, use exactly that. If it is silent, use the methodology's default and write "methodology default" in the working.
6. If the question asks for a quantity the methodology does not define, say so, define it in one sentence before computing, and write "ad hoc" in place of the section number.

## What if the data does not cover it?

7. Any month outside the window in methodology section 1 is answered per section 11: no number, no estimate, no figure from memory. A month after the window is refused exactly like a month before it.
8. Any asset not in the file, or any question that needs daily data, gets a one-line decline that says what the file does hold.

## What shape does the answer take?

9. Working first, short. Then the code and its printed result. Then one final line, exactly in this shape:

   `ANSWER: <value with unit> | METHOD: methodology section <n> | SOURCE: monthly-adjusted-close.csv, <columns>, rows <first date> to <last date>`

   For a refusal: `ANSWER: not in the dataset | METHOD: methodology section 11 | SOURCE: none`

10. Prose outside the code and the answer line stays under 120 words. The client wants the number, not an essay.

## What does this desk never do?

11. Never fetch live prices, search the web, or use memory of market history. Never recommend buying, selling or holding anything. Never paste a key, a token or a password into a chat.
