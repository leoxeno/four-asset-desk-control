1	# Four-asset desk: the map
2	
3	Instructions, not state. Read this first, every time, then go where the table sends you.
4	
5	One sentence: this folder answers numeric questions about four ETFs, SPY, TLT, GLD and USO, and the equal-weight portfolio of the four, from one month-end price file under one written methodology, and says plainly when the data does not cover the question.
6	
7	## What is this, what do I do next, where does the information come from, what breaks it?
8	
9	- What: a desk that turns a plain question into one checkable number with its method and its rows.
10	- Next: for a numeric question, read `rules.md`, then the one methodology section named in the table below, then compute from the price file. Open nothing else unless the route table sends you there.
11	- Information: only `reference/`. The price file holds the prices, the data dictionary says what the columns are, the methodology holds every convention. Nothing comes from memory of markets.
12	- Breaks: months outside the window the methodology defines, assets not in the file, anything needing daily prices, and any request for a forecast or advice.
13	
14	## Where things live
15	
16	| Path | What it holds | Kind |
17	|------|---------------|------|
18	| `identity.md` | the job, who asks, what goes out, what breaks it | instructions |
19	| `rules.md` | numbered pass conditions and the exact shape of the answer line | instructions |
20	| `examples.md` | two right answers and one wrong one, with why | instructions |
21	| `reference/methodology.md` | every convention, one section per quantity; the one home for every fact | state |
22	| `reference/data/data-dictionary.md` | columns, source, coverage of the price file | state |
23	| `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` | month-end adjusted closes, SPY TLT GLD USO | state |
24	
25	## Route by what was asked
26	
27	| If the question asks for | Read | Do not open | Then stop at |
28	|--------------------------|------|-------------|--------------|
29	| a return, volatility, Sharpe, drawdown, correlation, best or worst month, for an asset or the equal-weight portfolio | `rules.md`, the one methodology section from the table below, the price file | `identity.md`, `examples.md`, the data dictionary, the fetch log | the ANSWER line |
30	| a month before or after the data window | `reference/methodology.md` section 11 | everything else | a refusal with the reason, no number |
31	| an asset not in the file, daily data, a forecast, or what to buy | `identity.md`, last section | everything else | a one-line decline |
32	| how an answer should look, when rule 9 is not enough | `examples.md` | everything else | the matching example |
33	
34	Reading the whole folder is not wrong, but it is not the job. Each file is written so that a question needs at most three of them.
35	
36	## Which methodology section
37	
38	| Quantity | Section | Quantity | Section |
39	|----------|---------|----------|---------|
40	| what the file is, the window | 1 | annualised volatility, Sharpe | 6 |
41	| monthly return | 2 | maximum drawdown | 7 |
42	| the equal-weight portfolio | 3 | correlation | 8 |
43	| calendar-year return | 4 | best and worst month | 9 |
44	| cumulative return | 5 | rounding; outside the data | 10; 11 |
45	
46	## The one rule
47	
48	Every number comes from code run on the price file, under the methodology, and the answer line names the section and the rows. No number from memory, ever.
49	
50	## Size
51	
52	Roughly, in tokens: this map 550, identity 350, rules 550, examples 750, methodology 800, data dictionary 300, price file 1,000. Map plus rules plus one question's inputs lands near 3,000.

1	# Rules: pass conditions for every answer
2	
3	Instructions, not state. Load after `identity.md`, before computing anything. Each rule is stated once. The conventions they point to live in `reference/methodology.md` and are not repeated here.
4	
5	## What must be true of every number?
6	
7	1. It was computed by code that reads `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` directly, or rows copied from it verbatim. Never retype a price from memory, and never type a result from memory.
8	2. It follows the methodology section for that quantity. The README's section table says which one. The section number appears in the answer line.
9	3. Its inputs are stated: the columns used and the first and last row dates used.
10	4. It is rounded as methodology section 10 says, with its unit.
11	
12	## What if the question sets its own terms?
13	
14	5. If the question names a period, a weighting or a rebalancing rule, use exactly that. If it is silent, use the methodology's default and write "methodology default" in the working.
15	6. If the question asks for a quantity the methodology does not define, say so, define it in one sentence before computing, and write "ad hoc" in place of the section number.
16	
17	## What if the data does not cover it?
18	
19	7. Any month outside the window in methodology section 1 is answered per section 11: no number, no estimate, no figure from memory. A month after the window is refused exactly like a month before it.
20	8. Any asset not in the file, or any question that needs daily data, gets a one-line decline that says what the file does hold.
21	
22	## What shape does the answer take?
23	
24	9. Working first, short. Then the code and its printed result. Then one final line, exactly in this shape:
25	
26	   `ANSWER: <value with unit> | METHOD: methodology section <n> | SOURCE: monthly-adjusted-close.csv, <columns>, rows <first date> to <last date>`
27	
28	   For a refusal: `ANSWER: not in the dataset | METHOD: methodology section 11 | SOURCE: none`
29	
30	10. Prose outside the code and the answer line stays under 120 words. The client wants the number, not an essay.
31	
32	## What does this desk never do?
33	
34	11. Never fetch live prices, search the web, or use memory of market history. Never recommend buying, selling or holding anything. Never paste a key, a token or a password into a chat.
35

2	
3	State, not instructions. This is the one home for every convention. Load it before answering any question that involves a number, and name the section you used.
4	
5	## 1. What the dataset is
6	
7	- File: `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv`. Columns: `Date`, `SPY`, `TLT`, `GLD`, `USO`.
8	- `Date` is the calendar month end. The price on that row is the adjusted close of the last trading day in that month.
9	- Prices are Yahoo Finance adjusted closes (dividends and splits applied), rounded to four decimals, retrieved with `tools/fetch_data.py`. The fetch time is in `reference/data/fetch-log.txt`.
10	- The first row, 2022-12-31, is a base price only. Return months run from 2023-01 to 2026-09, 45 months in all.
11	- The four assets stand for: SPY US stocks, TLT US long-term Treasury bonds, GLD gold, USO oil.
12	
13	## 2. Monthly return
14	
15	Simple return: price this month end divided by price last month end, minus one. Not log returns. Computed per asset from adjusted close.
16	
17	## 3. The house portfolio
18	
19	Equal weight, 25 percent in each of the four assets, rebalanced back to equal weight at every month end. Its monthly return is therefore the plain average of the four assets' monthly returns in that month.
20	
21	Buy and hold is a different portfolio and not the house portfolio: 25 percent in each asset bought at the 2022-12-31 prices and never rebalanced. When a question says "the portfolio" without qualification it means the house portfolio.
22	
23	## 4. Calendar-year total return
24	
25	Compound the twelve monthly returns of that year: multiply (1 + each monthly return), subtract one. Only 2023, 2024 and 2025 are complete years. 2026 runs January to September only and is reported as year to date, never as a calendar-year return.
26	
27	## 5. Cumulative return over a period
28	
29	Multiply (1 + each monthly return) across the period, subtract one. "The full period" means 2023-01 to 2026-09.
30	
31	## 6. Annualised volatility
32	
33	Sample standard deviation of the monthly returns (divide by n minus 1) multiplied by the square root of 12.
34	
35	For the Sharpe ratio, annualised return is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns multiplied by 12, the risk-free rate is zero, and Sharpe is annualised return divided by annualised volatility. This is a stated simplification, not a claim about the right risk-free rate.
36	
37	## 7. Maximum drawdown
38	
39	Build the cumulative index: start at 1.00 on 2022-12-31 and multiply by (1 + monthly return) each month. Drawdown in a month is the index divided by its running peak, minus one. Maximum drawdown is the most negative drawdown; the trough month is the month in which it occurs.
40	
41	## 8. Correlation
42	
43	Pearson correlation of monthly returns over the stated period. Never of price levels. Correlating price levels is the common mistake this section exists to stop.
44	
45	## 9. Best and worst month
46	
47	The largest and smallest monthly return in the stated period, for an asset or for the house portfolio.
48	
49	## 10. Rounding and format
50	
51	Returns, volatility and drawdowns in percent to one decimal. Sharpe ratios and correlations to two decimals. Months as YYYY-MM.
52	
53	## 11. Outside the dataset
54	
55	Any month before 2023-01 or after 2026-09 is not in the dataset. The answer is "not in the dataset; the data ends 2026-09-30", with no number, no estimate, and no figure from memory.
56	
57	## 12. What this file never does
58	
59	It never holds a computed answer. Answers come from the data through these rules at the moment they are asked.

GLD had the highest total return in calendar year 2024: **+26.7%**. SPY was close behind at +24.9%.

I compounded the 12 monthly returns from January to December 2024 for each ETF, using the month-end prices from 2023-12-31 to 2024-12-31. The prices in the file are already adjusted for dividends and splits, so the returns include reinvested dividends.

```python
rows=[r for r in rows if '2023-12-31'<=r['Date']<='2024-12-31']
for a in ['SPY','TLT','GLD','USO']:

14	5. If the question names a period, a weighting or a rebalancing rule, use exactly that. If it is silent, use the methodology's default and write "methodology default" in the working.
15	6. If the question asks for a quantity the methodology does not define, say so, define it in one sentence before computing, and write "ad hoc" in place of the section number.
16	
17	## What if the data does not cover it?
18	
19	7. Any month outside the window in methodology section 1 is answered per section 11: no number, no estimate, no figure from memory. A month after the window is refused exactly like a month before it.
20	8. Any asset not in the file, or any question that needs daily data, gets a one-line decline that says what the file does hold.
21	
22	## What shape does the answer take?
23	
24	9. Working first, short. Then the code and its printed result. Then one final line, exactly in this shape:
25	
26	   `ANSWER: <value with unit> | METHOD: methodology section <n> | SOURCE: monthly-adjusted-close.csv, <columns>, rows <first date> to <last date>`
27	
28	   For a refusal: `ANSWER: not in the dataset | METHOD: methodology section 11 | SOURCE: none`
29	
30	10. Prose outside the code and the answer line stays under 120 words. The client wants the number, not an essay.
31	
32	## What does this desk never do?
33	
34	11. Never fetch live prices, search the web, or use memory of market history. Never recommend buying, selling or holding anything. Never paste a key, a token or a password into a chat.

1	# Methodology: how the desk computes every number
2	
3	State, not instructions. This is the one home for every convention. Load it before answering any question that involves a number, and name the section you used.
4	
5	## 1. What the dataset is
6	
7	- File: `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv`. Columns: `Date`, `SPY`, `TLT`, `GLD`, `USO`.
8	- `Date` is the calendar month end. The price on that row is the adjusted close of the last trading day in that month.
9	- Prices are Yahoo Finance adjusted closes (dividends and splits applied), rounded to four decimals, retrieved with `tools/fetch_data.py`. The fetch time is in `reference/data/fetch-log.txt`.
10	- The first row, 2022-12-31, is a base price only. Return months run from 2023-01 to 2026-09, 45 months in all.
11	- The four assets stand for: SPY US stocks, TLT US long-term Treasury bonds, GLD gold, USO oil.
12	
13	## 2. Monthly return
14	
15	Simple return: price this month end divided by price last month end, minus one. Not log returns. Computed per asset from adjusted close.
16	
17	## 3. The house portfolio
18	
19	Equal weight, 25 percent in each of the four assets, rebalanced back to equal weight at every month end. Its monthly return is therefore the plain average of the four assets' monthly returns in that month.
20	
21	Buy and hold is a different portfolio and not the house portfolio: 25 percent in each asset bought at the 2022-12-31 prices and never rebalanced. When a question says "the portfolio" without qualification it means the house portfolio.
22	
23	## 4. Calendar-year total return
24	
25	Compound the twelve monthly returns of that year: multiply (1 + each monthly return), subtract one. Only 2023, 2024 and 2025 are complete years. 2026 runs January to September only and is reported as year to date, never as a calendar-year return.
26	
27	## 5. Cumulative return over a period
28	
29	Multiply (1 + each monthly return) across the period, subtract one. "The full period" means 2023-01 to 2026-09.
30	
31	## 6. Annualised volatility
32	
33	Sample standard deviation of the monthly returns (divide by n minus 1) multiplied by the square root of 12.
34	
35	For the Sharpe ratio, annualised return is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns multiplied by 12, the risk-free rate is zero, and Sharpe is annualised return divided by annualised volatility. This is a stated simplification, not a claim about the right risk-free rate.
36	
37	## 7. Maximum drawdown
38	
39	Build the cumulative index: start at 1.00 on 2022-12-31 and multiply by (1 + monthly return) each month. Drawdown in a month is the index divided by its running peak, minus one. Maximum drawdown is the most negative drawdown; the trough month is the month in which it occurs.
40	
41	## 8. Correlation
42	
43	Pearson correlation of monthly returns over the stated period. Never of price levels. Correlating price levels is the common mistake this section exists to stop.
44	
45	## 9. Best and worst month
46	
47	The largest and smallest monthly return in the stated period, for an asset or for the house portfolio.
48	
49	## 10. Rounding and format
50	
51	Returns, volatility and drawdowns in percent to one decimal. Sharpe ratios and correlations to two decimals. Months as YYYY-MM.
52	
53	## 11. Outside the dataset
54	
55	Any month before 2023-01 or after 2026-09 is not in the dataset. The answer is "not in the dataset; the data ends 2026-09-30", with no number, no estimate, and no figure from memory.
56	
57	## 12. What this file never does
58	
59	It never holds a computed answer. Answers come from the data through these rules at the moment they are asked.

```

GLD's total return for calendar year 2025 was **+63.7%**, with dividends and splits included through the adjusted prices.

I multiplied together (1 + each monthly return) for the twelve months from 2025-01 to 2025-12, then subtracted one (methodology section 4). The 2024-12-31 adjusted close of 242.13 is the base price and the 2025-12-31 adjusted close is 396.31. The result is rounded to one decimal place (section 10).

```python
import csv
rows = list(csv.DictReader(open('reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv')))
p = {r['Date']: float(r['GLD']) for r in rows}
ds = sorted(d for d in p if '2024-12-31' <= d <= '2025-12-31')
g = 1
for a, b in zip(ds, ds[1:]): g *= p[b] / p[a]
print(round((g - 1) * 100, 4))
```
Output: `2024-12-31 242.13 2025-12-31 396.31 12` → `63.6765`

1	# Four-asset desk: the map
2	
3	Instructions, not state. Read this first, every time, then go where the table sends you.
4	
5	One sentence: this folder answers numeric questions about four ETFs, SPY, TLT, GLD and USO, and the equal-weight portfolio of the four, from one month-end price file under one written methodology, and says plainly when the data does not cover the question.
6	
7	## What is this, what do I do next, where does the information come from, what breaks it?
8	
9	- What: a desk that turns a plain question into one checkable number with its method and its rows.
10	- Next: for a numeric question, read `rules.md`, then the one methodology section named in the table below, then compute from the price file. Open nothing else unless the route table sends you there.
11	- Information: only `reference/`. The price file holds the prices, the data dictionary says what the columns are, the methodology holds every convention. Nothing comes from memory of markets.
12	- Breaks: months outside the window the methodology defines, assets not in the file, anything needing daily prices, and any request for a forecast or advice.
13	
14	## Where things live
15	
16	| Path | What it holds | Kind |
17	|------|---------------|------|
18	| `identity.md` | the job, who asks, what goes out, what breaks it | instructions |
19	| `rules.md` | numbered pass conditions and the exact shape of the answer line | instructions |
20	| `examples.md` | two right answers and one wrong one, with why | instructions |
21	| `reference/methodology.md` | every convention, one section per quantity; the one home for every fact | state |
22	| `reference/data/data-dictionary.md` | columns, source, coverage of the price file | state |
23	| `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` | month-end adjusted closes, SPY TLT GLD USO | state |
24	
25	## Route by what was asked
26	
27	| If the question asks for | Read | Do not open | Then stop at |
28	|--------------------------|------|-------------|--------------|
29	| a return, volatility, Sharpe, drawdown, correlation, best or worst month, for an asset or the equal-weight portfolio | `rules.md`, the one methodology section from the table below, the price file | `identity.md`, `examples.md`, the data dictionary, the fetch log | the ANSWER line |
30	| a month before or after the data window | `reference/methodology.md` section 11 | everything else | a refusal with the reason, no number |
31	| an asset not in the file, daily data, a forecast, or what to buy | `identity.md`, last section | everything else | a one-line decline |
32	| how an answer should look, when rule 9 is not enough | `examples.md` | everything else | the matching example |
33	
34	Reading the whole folder is not wrong, but it is not the job. Each file is written so that a question needs at most three of them.
35	
36	## Which methodology section
37	
38	| Quantity | Section | Quantity | Section |
39	|----------|---------|----------|---------|
40	| what the file is, the window | 1 | annualised volatility, Sharpe | 6 |
41	| monthly return | 2 | maximum drawdown | 7 |
42	| the equal-weight portfolio | 3 | correlation | 8 |
43	| calendar-year return | 4 | best and worst month | 9 |
44	| cumulative return | 5 | rounding; outside the data | 10; 11 |
45	
46	## The one rule
47	
48	Every number comes from code run on the price file, under the methodology, and the answer line names the section and the rows. No number from memory, ever.
49	
50	## Size
51	
52	Roughly, in tokens: this map 550, identity 350, rules 550, examples 750, methodology 800, data dictionary 300, price file 1,000. Map plus rules plus one question's inputs lands near 3,000.

1	# Rules: pass conditions for every answer
2	
3	Instructions, not state. Load after `identity.md`, before computing anything. Each rule is stated once. The conventions they point to live in `reference/methodology.md` and are not repeated here.
4	
5	## What must be true of every number?
6	
7	1. It was computed by code that reads `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` directly, or rows copied from it verbatim. Never retype a price from memory, and never type a result from memory.
8	2. It follows the methodology section for that quantity. The README's section table says which one. The section number appears in the answer line.
9	3. Its inputs are stated: the columns used and the first and last row dates used.
10	4. It is rounded as methodology section 10 says, with its unit.
11	
12	## What if the question sets its own terms?
13	
14	5. If the question names a period, a weighting or a rebalancing rule, use exactly that. If it is silent, use the methodology's default and write "methodology default" in the working.
15	6. If the question asks for a quantity the methodology does not define, say so, define it in one sentence before computing, and write "ad hoc" in place of the section number.
16	
17	## What if the data does not cover it?
18	
19	7. Any month outside the window in methodology section 1 is answered per section 11: no number, no estimate, no figure from memory. A month after the window is refused exactly like a month before it.
20	8. Any asset not in the file, or any question that needs daily data, gets a one-line decline that says what the file does hold.
21	
22	## What shape does the answer take?
23	
24	9. Working first, short. Then the code and its printed result. Then one final line, exactly in this shape:
25	
26	   `ANSWER: <value with unit> | METHOD: methodology section <n> | SOURCE: monthly-adjusted-close.csv, <columns>, rows <first date> to <last date>`
27	
28	   For a refusal: `ANSWER: not in the dataset | METHOD: methodology section 11 | SOURCE: none`

9	- Prices are Yahoo Finance adjusted closes (dividends and splits applied), rounded to four decimals, retrieved with `tools/fetch_data.py`. The fetch time is in `reference/data/fetch-log.txt`.
10	- The first row, 2022-12-31, is a base price only. Return months run from 2023-01 to 2026-09, 45 months in all.
11	- The four assets stand for: SPY US stocks, TLT US long-term Treasury bonds, GLD gold, USO oil.
12	
13	## 2. Monthly return
14	
15	Simple return: price this month end divided by price last month end, minus one. Not log returns. Computed per asset from adjusted close.
16	
17	## 3. The house portfolio
18	
19	Equal weight, 25 percent in each of the four assets, rebalanced back to equal weight at every month end. Its monthly return is therefore the plain average of the four assets' monthly returns in that month.
20	
21	Buy and hold is a different portfolio and not the house portfolio: 25 percent in each asset bought at the 2022-12-31 prices and never rebalanced. When a question says "the portfolio" without qualification it means the house portfolio.
22	
23	## 4. Calendar-year total return
24	
25	Compound the twelve monthly returns of that year: multiply (1 + each monthly return), subtract one. Only 2023, 2024 and 2025 are complete years. 2026 runs January to September only and is reported as year to date, never as a calendar-year return.
26	
27	## 5. Cumulative return over a period
28	
29	Multiply (1 + each monthly return) across the period, subtract one. "The full period" means 2023-01 to 2026-09.
30	
31	## 6. Annualised volatility
32	
33	Sample standard deviation of the monthly returns (divide by n minus 1) multiplied by the square root of 12.
34	
35	For the Sharpe ratio, annualised return is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns multiplied by 12, the risk-free rate is zero, and Sharpe is annualised return divided by annualised volatility. This is a stated simplification, not a claim about the right risk-free rate.
36	
37	## 7. Maximum drawdown
38	
39	Build the cumulative index: start at 1.00 on 2022-12-31 and multiply by (1 + monthly return) each month. Drawdown in a month is the index divided by its running peak, minus one. Maximum drawdown is the most negative drawdown; the trough month is the month in which it occurs.
40	
41	## 8. Correlation
42	
43	Pearson correlation of monthly returns over the stated period. Never of price levels. Correlating price levels is the common mistake this section exists to stop.
44	
45	## 9. Best and worst month
46	
47	The largest and smallest monthly return in the stated period, for an asset or for the house portfolio.
48	
49	## 10. Rounding and format
50	
51	Returns, volatility and drawdowns in percent to one decimal. Sharpe ratios and correlations to two decimals. Months as YYYY-MM.
52	
53	## 11. Outside the dataset
54	
55	Any month before 2023-01 or after 2026-09 is not in the dataset. The answer is "not in the dataset; the data ends 2026-09-30", with no number, no estimate, and no figure from memory.

```

From January 2023 to September 2026, the correlation between SPY and TLT monthly returns was 0.57.

How it was worked out:
- **Data:** I used the month-end adjusted closes for SPY and TLT in the desk's price file. The 2022-12-31 row only serves as the starting price, which gives 45 monthly returns from 2023-01 to 2026-09.
- **Returns:** each monthly return is this month-end price divided by last month-end price, minus one.
- **Correlation:** a standard (Pearson) correlation of the two sets of monthly returns, not of the prices themselves, rounded to two decimals.

```python
import csv, statistics as s
r = list(csv.DictReader(open('reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv')))
ret = lambda c: [float(r[i][c])/float(r[i-1][c]) - 1 for i in range(1, len(r))]
a, b = ret('SPY'), ret('TLT')
print(len(a), r[1]['Date'], r[-1]['Date'])
print(round(s.correlation(a, b), 4))
```
```

# Four-asset desk: the map

Instructions, not state. Read this first, every time, then go where the table sends you.

One sentence: this folder answers numeric questions about four ETFs, SPY, TLT, GLD and USO, and the equal-weight portfolio of the four, from one month-end price file under one written methodology, and says plainly when the data does not cover the question.

## What is this, what do I do next, where does the information come from, what breaks it?

- What: a desk that turns a plain question into one checkable number with its method and its rows.
- Next: for a numeric question, read `rules.md`, then the one methodology section named in the table below, then compute from the price file. Open nothing else unless the route table sends you there.
- Information: only `reference/`. The price file holds the prices, the data dictionary says what the columns are, the methodology holds every convention. Nothing comes from memory of markets.
- Breaks: months outside the window the methodology defines, assets not in the file, anything needing daily prices, and any request for a forecast or advice.

## Where things live

| Path | What it holds | Kind |
|------|---------------|------|
| `identity.md` | the job, who asks, what goes out, what breaks it | instructions |
| `rules.md` | numbered pass conditions and the exact shape of the answer line | instructions |
| `examples.md` | two right answers and one wrong one, with why | instructions |
| `reference/methodology.md` | every convention, one section per quantity; the one home for every fact | state |
| `reference/data/data-dictionary.md` | columns, source, coverage of the price file | state |
| `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` | month-end adjusted closes, SPY TLT GLD USO | state |

## Route by what was asked

| If the question asks for | Read | Do not open | Then stop at |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|--------------|
| a return, volatility, Sharpe, drawdown, correlation, best or worst month, for an asset or the equal-weight portfolio | `rules.md`, the one methodology section from the table below, the price file | `identity.md`, `examples.md`, the data dictionary, the fetch log | the ANSWER line |
| a month before or after the data window | `reference/methodology.md` section 11 | everything else | a refusal with the reason, no number |
| an asset not in the file, daily data, a forecast, or what to buy | `identity.md`, last section | everything else | a one-line decline |
| how an answer should look, when rule 9 is not enough | `examples.md` | everything else | the matching example |

Reading the whole folder is not wrong, but it is not the job. Each file is written so that a question needs at most three of them.

## Which methodology section

| Quantity | Section | Quantity | Section |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| what the file is, the window | 1 | annualised volatility, Sharpe | 6 |
| monthly return | 2 | maximum drawdown | 7 |
| the equal-weight portfolio | 3 | correlation | 8 |
| calendar-year return | 4 | best and worst month | 9 |
| cumulative return | 5 | rounding; outside the data | 10; 11 |

## The one rule

Every number comes from code run on the price file, under the methodology, and the answer line names the section and the rows. No number from memory, ever.

## Size

Roughly, in tokens: this map 550, identity 350, rules 550, examples 750, methodology 800, data dictionary 300, price file 1,000. Map plus rules plus one question's inputs lands near 3,000.

# Rules: pass conditions for every answer

Instructions, not state. Load after `identity.md`, before computing anything. Each rule is stated once. The conventions they point to live in `reference/methodology.md` and are not repeated here.

## What must be true of every number?

1. It was computed by code that reads `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` directly, or rows copied from it verbatim. Never retype a price from memory, and never type a result from memory.
2. It follows the methodology section for that quantity. The README's section table says which one. The section number appears in the answer line.
3. Its inputs are stated: the columns used and the first and last row dates used.
4. It is rounded as methodology section 10 says, with its unit.

## What if the question sets its own terms?

5. If the question names a period, a weighting or a rebalancing rule, use exactly that. If it is silent, use the methodology's default and write "methodology default" in the working.
6. If the question asks for a quantity the methodology does not define, say so, define it in one sentence before computing, and write "ad hoc" in place of the section number.

## What if the data does not cover it?

7. Any month outside the window in methodology section 1 is answered per section 11: no number, no estimate, no figure from memory. A month after the window is refused exactly like a month before it.
8. Any asset not in the file, or any question that needs daily data, gets a one-line decline that says what the file does hold.

## What shape does the answer take?

9. Working first, short. Then the code and its printed result. Then one final line, exactly in this shape:

   `ANSWER: <value with unit> | METHOD: methodology section <n> | SOURCE: monthly-adjusted-close.csv, <columns>, rows <first date> to <last date>`

   For a refusal: `ANSWER: not in the dataset | METHOD: methodology section 11 | SOURCE: none`

10. Prose outside the code and the answer line stays under 120 words. The client wants the number, not an essay.

## What does this desk never do?

11. Never fetch live prices, search the web, or use memory of market history. Never recommend buying, selling or holding anything. Never paste a key, a token or a password into a chat.
# Methodology: how the desk computes every number

State, not instructions. This is the one home for every convention. Load it before answering any question that involves a number, and name the section you used.

## 1. What the dataset is

- File: `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv`. Columns: `Date`, `SPY`, `TLT`, `GLD`, `USO`.
- `Date` is the calendar month end. The price on that row is the adjusted close of the last trading day in that month.
- Prices are Yahoo Finance adjusted closes (dividends and splits applied), rounded to four decimals, retrieved with `tools/fetch_data.py`. The fetch time is in `reference/data/fetch-log.txt`.
- The first row, 2022-12-31, is a base price only. Return months run from 2023-01 to 2026-09, 45 months in all.
- The four assets stand for: SPY US stocks, TLT US long-term Treasury bonds, GLD gold, USO oil.

## 2. Monthly return

Simple return: price this month end divided by price last month end, minus one. Not log returns. Computed per asset from adjusted close.

## 3. The house portfolio

Equal weight, 25 percent in each of the four assets, rebalanced back to equal weight at every month end. Its monthly return is therefore the plain average of the four assets' monthly returns in that month.

Buy and hold is a different portfolio and not the house portfolio: 25 percent in each asset bought at the 2022-12-31 prices and never rebalanced. When a question says "the portfolio" without qualification it means the house portfolio.

## 4. Calendar-year total return

Compound the twelve monthly returns of that year: multiply (1 + each monthly return), subtract one. Only 2023, 2024 and 2025 are complete years. 2026 runs January to September only and is reported as year to date, never as a calendar-year return.

## 5. Cumulative return over a period

Multiply (1 + each monthly return) across the period, subtract one. "The full period" means 2023-01 to 2026-09.

## 6. Annualised volatility

Sample standard deviation of the monthly returns (divide by n minus 1) multiplied by the square root of 12.

For the Sharpe ratio, annualised return is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns multiplied by 12, the risk-free rate is zero, and Sharpe is annualised return divided by annualised volatility. This is a stated simplification, not a claim about the right risk-free rate.

## 7. Maximum drawdown

Build the cumulative index: start at 1.00 on 2022-12-31 and multiply by (1 + monthly return) each month. Drawdown in a month is the index divided by its running peak, minus one. Maximum drawdown is the most negative drawdown; the trough month is the month in which it occurs.

## 8. Correlation

Pearson correlation of monthly returns over the stated period. Never of price levels. Correlating price levels is the common mistake this section exists to stop.

## 9. Best and worst month

The largest and smallest monthly return in the stated period, for an asset or for the house portfolio.

## 10. Rounding and format

Returns, volatility and drawdowns in percent to one decimal. Sharpe ratios and correlations to two decimals. Months as YYYY-MM.

## 11. Outside the dataset

Any month before 2023-01 or after 2026-09 is not in the dataset. The answer is "not in the dataset; the data ends 2026-09-30", with no number, no estimate, and no figure from memory.

## 12. What this file never does

It never holds a computed answer. Answers come from the data through these rules at the moment they are asked.

The portfolio's cumulative total return from January 2023 to September 2026 was **85.5%**.

How it was calculated:
- **Portfolio (section 3):** your terms match the desk's standard portfolio, 25% in each of SPY, TLT, GLD and USO, rebalanced every month end. So each month's portfolio return is the plain average of the four assets' simple monthly returns, based on adjusted closes, which include dividends.
- **Cumulative return (section 5):** I multiplied (1 + monthly return) across all 45 months from 2023-01 to 2026-09, then subtracted 1. The 2022-12-31 row is used only as the starting price.

```python
rows=list(csv.DictReader(open('reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv')))
idx=1.0
for p,c in zip(rows,rows[1:]):
    idx*=1+sum(float(c[k])/float(p[k])-1 for k in ['SPY','TLT','GLD','USO'])/4

# Rules: pass conditions for every answer

Instructions, not state. Load after `identity.md`, before computing anything. Each rule is stated once. The conventions they point to live in `reference/methodology.md` and are not repeated here.

## What must be true of every number?

1. It was computed by code that reads `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` directly, or rows copied from it verbatim. Never retype a price from memory, and never type a result from memory.
2. It follows the methodology section for that quantity. The README's section table says which one. The section number appears in the answer line.
3. Its inputs are stated: the columns used and the first and last row dates used.
4. It is rounded as methodology section 10 says, with its unit.

## What if the question sets its own terms?

5. If the question names a period, a weighting or a rebalancing rule, use exactly that. If it is silent, use the methodology's default and write "methodology default" in the working.
6. If the question asks for a quantity the methodology does not define, say so, define it in one sentence before computing, and write "ad hoc" in place of the section number.

## What if the data does not cover it?

7. Any month outside the window in methodology section 1 is answered per section 11: no number, no estimate, no figure from memory. A month after the window is refused exactly like a month before it.
8. Any asset not in the file, or any question that needs daily data, gets a one-line decline that says what the file does hold.

## What shape does the answer take?

9. Working first, short. Then the code and its printed result. Then one final line, exactly in this shape:

   `ANSWER: <value with unit> | METHOD: methodology section <n> | SOURCE: monthly-adjusted-close.csv, <columns>, rows <first date> to <last date>`

   For a refusal: `ANSWER: not in the dataset | METHOD: methodology section 11 | SOURCE: none`

10. Prose outside the code and the answer line stays under 120 words. The client wants the number, not an essay.

## What does this desk never do?

11. Never fetch live prices, search the web, or use memory of market history. Never recommend buying, selling or holding anything. Never paste a key, a token or a password into a chat.
# Methodology: how the desk computes every number

State, not instructions. This is the one home for every convention. Load it before answering any question that involves a number, and name the section you used.

## 1. What the dataset is

- File: `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv`. Columns: `Date`, `SPY`, `TLT`, `GLD`, `USO`.
- `Date` is the calendar month end. The price on that row is the adjusted close of the last trading day in that month.
- Prices are Yahoo Finance adjusted closes (dividends and splits applied), rounded to four decimals, retrieved with `tools/fetch_data.py`. The fetch time is in `reference/data/fetch-log.txt`.
- The first row, 2022-12-31, is a base price only. Return months run from 2023-01 to 2026-09, 45 months in all.
- The four assets stand for: SPY US stocks, TLT US long-term Treasury bonds, GLD gold, USO oil.

## 2. Monthly return

Simple return: price this month end divided by price last month end, minus one. Not log returns. Computed per asset from adjusted close.

## 3. The house portfolio

Equal weight, 25 percent in each of the four assets, rebalanced back to equal weight at every month end. Its monthly return is therefore the plain average of the four assets' monthly returns in that month.

Buy and hold is a different portfolio and not the house portfolio: 25 percent in each asset bought at the 2022-12-31 prices and never rebalanced. When a question says "the portfolio" without qualification it means the house portfolio.

## 4. Calendar-year total return

Compound the twelve monthly returns of that year: multiply (1 + each monthly return), subtract one. Only 2023, 2024 and 2025 are complete years. 2026 runs January to September only and is reported as year to date, never as a calendar-year return.

## 5. Cumulative return over a period

Multiply (1 + each monthly return) across the period, subtract one. "The full period" means 2023-01 to 2026-09.

## 6. Annualised volatility

Sample standard deviation of the monthly returns (divide by n minus 1) multiplied by the square root of 12.

For the Sharpe ratio, annualised return is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns multiplied by 12, the risk-free rate is zero, and Sharpe is annualised return divided by annualised volatility. This is a stated simplification, not a claim about the right risk-free rate.

## 7. Maximum drawdown

Build the cumulative index: start at 1.00 on 2022-12-31 and multiply by (1 + monthly return) each month. Drawdown in a month is the index divided by its running peak, minus one. Maximum drawdown is the most negative drawdown; the trough month is the month in which it occurs.

## 8. Correlation

Pearson correlation of monthly returns over the stated period. Never of price levels. Correlating price levels is the common mistake this section exists to stop.

## 9. Best and worst month

The largest and smallest monthly return in the stated period, for an asset or for the house portfolio.

## 10. Rounding and format

Returns, volatility and drawdowns in percent to one decimal. Sharpe ratios and correlations to two decimals. Months as YYYY-MM.

## 11. Outside the dataset

Any month before 2023-01 or after 2026-09 is not in the dataset. The answer is "not in the dataset; the data ends 2026-09-30", with no number, no estimate, and no figure from memory.

## 12. What this file never does

It never holds a computed answer. Answers come from the data through these rules at the moment they are asked.

```

The maximum drawdown was **−9.1%**, and the trough was in **2026-06** (June 2026). The peak before it was 2026-04.

**Method:** I used the house portfolio: 25% in each of SPY, TLT, GLD and USO, rebalanced back to equal weight every month end. Each month's portfolio return is the plain average of the four simple monthly returns. I built an index starting at 1.00 on 2022-12-31 and grew it by each month's return. Each month's drawdown is the index divided by its highest value so far, minus one. The maximum drawdown is the most negative of these. This covers 45 return months, 2023-01 to 2026-09.

1	# Four-asset desk: the map
2	
3	Instructions, not state. Read this first, every time, then go where the table sends you.
4	
5	One sentence: this folder answers numeric questions about four ETFs, SPY, TLT, GLD and USO, and the equal-weight portfolio of the four, from one month-end price file under one written methodology, and says plainly when the data does not cover the question.
6	
7	## What is this, what do I do next, where does the information come from, what breaks it?
8	
9	- What: a desk that turns a plain question into one checkable number with its method and its rows.
10	- Next: for a numeric question, read `rules.md`, then the one methodology section named in the table below, then compute from the price file. Open nothing else unless the route table sends you there.
11	- Information: only `reference/`. The price file holds the prices, the data dictionary says what the columns are, the methodology holds every convention. Nothing comes from memory of markets.
12	- Breaks: months outside the window the methodology defines, assets not in the file, anything needing daily prices, and any request for a forecast or advice.
13	
14	## Where things live
15	
16	| Path | What it holds | Kind |
17	|------|---------------|------|
18	| `identity.md` | the job, who asks, what goes out, what breaks it | instructions |
19	| `rules.md` | numbered pass conditions and the exact shape of the answer line | instructions |
20	| `examples.md` | two right answers and one wrong one, with why | instructions |
21	| `reference/methodology.md` | every convention, one section per quantity; the one home for every fact | state |
22	| `reference/data/data-dictionary.md` | columns, source, coverage of the price file | state |
23	| `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` | month-end adjusted closes, SPY TLT GLD USO | state |
24	
25	## Route by what was asked
26	
27	| If the question asks for | Read | Do not open | Then stop at |
28	|--------------------------|------|-------------|--------------|
29	| a return, volatility, Sharpe, drawdown, correlation, best or worst month, for an asset or the equal-weight portfolio | `rules.md`, the one methodology section from the table below, the price file | `identity.md`, `examples.md`, the data dictionary, the fetch log | the ANSWER line |
30	| a month before or after the data window | `reference/methodology.md` section 11 | everything else | a refusal with the reason, no number |
31	| an asset not in the file, daily data, a forecast, or what to buy | `identity.md`, last section | everything else | a one-line decline |
32	| how an answer should look, when rule 9 is not enough | `examples.md` | everything else | the matching example |
33	
34	Reading the whole folder is not wrong, but it is not the job. Each file is written so that a question needs at most three of them.
35	
36	## Which methodology section
37	
38	| Quantity | Section | Quantity | Section |

```

USO's annualised volatility over this period was **39.6%**.

I used the USO monthly returns from 2023-01 to 2026-09, which is all 45 return months in the price file. Each monthly return is that month-end price divided by the previous month-end price, minus one (section 2). The 2022-12-31 row is used only as the starting price for January 2023. The annualised volatility is the sample standard deviation of those returns (dividing by n−1) multiplied by √12 (section 6).

```
46 rows: 2022-12-31 to 2026-09-30
45 returns: 2023-01-31 to 2026-09-30

# Four-asset desk: the map

Instructions, not state. Read this first, every time, then go where the table sends you.

One sentence: this folder answers numeric questions about four ETFs, SPY, TLT, GLD and USO, and the equal-weight portfolio of the four, from one month-end price file under one written methodology, and says plainly when the data does not cover the question.

## What is this, what do I do next, where does the information come from, what breaks it?

- What: a desk that turns a plain question into one checkable number with its method and its rows.
- Next: for a numeric question, read `rules.md`, then the one methodology section named in the table below, then compute from the price file. Open nothing else unless the route table sends you there.
- Information: only `reference/`. The price file holds the prices, the data dictionary says what the columns are, the methodology holds every convention. Nothing comes from memory of markets.
- Breaks: months outside the window the methodology defines, assets not in the file, anything needing daily prices, and any request for a forecast or advice.

## Where things live

| Path | What it holds | Kind |
|------|---------------|------|
| `identity.md` | the job, who asks, what goes out, what breaks it | instructions |
| `rules.md` | numbered pass conditions and the exact shape of the answer line | instructions |
| `examples.md` | two right answers and one wrong one, with why | instructions |
| `reference/methodology.md` | every convention, one section per quantity; the one home for every fact | state |
| `reference/data/data-dictionary.md` | columns, source, coverage of the price file | state |
| `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` | month-end adjusted closes, SPY TLT GLD USO | state |

## Route by what was asked

| If the question asks for | Read | Do not open | Then stop at |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|--------------|
| a return, volatility, Sharpe, drawdown, correlation, best or worst month, for an asset or the equal-weight portfolio | `rules.md`, the one methodology section from the table below, the price file | `identity.md`, `examples.md`, the data dictionary, the fetch log | the ANSWER line |
| a month before or after the data window | `reference/methodology.md` section 11 | everything else | a refusal with the reason, no number |
| an asset not in the file, daily data, a forecast, or what to buy | `identity.md`, last section | everything else | a one-line decline |
| how an answer should look, when rule 9 is not enough | `examples.md` | everything else | the matching example |

Reading the whole folder is not wrong, but it is not the job. Each file is written so that a question needs at most three of them.

## Which methodology section

| Quantity | Section | Quantity | Section |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| what the file is, the window | 1 | annualised volatility, Sharpe | 6 |
| monthly return | 2 | maximum drawdown | 7 |
| the equal-weight portfolio | 3 | correlation | 8 |
| calendar-year return | 4 | best and worst month | 9 |
| cumulative return | 5 | rounding; outside the data | 10; 11 |

## The one rule

Every number comes from code run on the price file, under the methodology, and the answer line names the section and the rows. No number from memory, ever.

## Size

Roughly, in tokens: this map 550, identity 350, rules 550, examples 750, methodology 800, data dictionary 300, price file 1,000. Map plus rules plus one question's inputs lands near 3,000.

# Rules: pass conditions for every answer

Instructions, not state. Load after `identity.md`, before computing anything. Each rule is stated once. The conventions they point to live in `reference/methodology.md` and are not repeated here.

## What must be true of every number?

1. It was computed by code that reads `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` directly, or rows copied from it verbatim. Never retype a price from memory, and never type a result from memory.
2. It follows the methodology section for that quantity. The README's section table says which one. The section number appears in the answer line.
3. Its inputs are stated: the columns used and the first and last row dates used.
4. It is rounded as methodology section 10 says, with its unit.

## What if the question sets its own terms?

5. If the question names a period, a weighting or a rebalancing rule, use exactly that. If it is silent, use the methodology's default and write "methodology default" in the working.
6. If the question asks for a quantity the methodology does not define, say so, define it in one sentence before computing, and write "ad hoc" in place of the section number.

## What if the data does not cover it?

7. Any month outside the window in methodology section 1 is answered per section 11: no number, no estimate, no figure from memory. A month after the window is refused exactly like a month before it.
8. Any asset not in the file, or any question that needs daily data, gets a one-line decline that says what the file does hold.

## What shape does the answer take?

9. Working first, short. Then the code and its printed result. Then one final line, exactly in this shape:

   `ANSWER: <value with unit> | METHOD: methodology section <n> | SOURCE: monthly-adjusted-close.csv, <columns>, rows <first date> to <last date>`

   For a refusal: `ANSWER: not in the dataset | METHOD: methodology section 11 | SOURCE: none`

10. Prose outside the code and the answer line stays under 120 words. The client wants the number, not an essay.

## What does this desk never do?

11. Never fetch live prices, search the web, or use memory of market history. Never recommend buying, selling or holding anything. Never paste a key, a token or a password into a chat.
----
# Methodology: how the desk computes every number

State, not instructions. This is the one home for every convention. Load it before answering any question that involves a number, and name the section you used.

## 1. What the dataset is

- File: `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv`. Columns: `Date`, `SPY`, `TLT`, `GLD`, `USO`.
- `Date` is the calendar month end. The price on that row is the adjusted close of the last trading day in that month.
- Prices are Yahoo Finance adjusted closes (dividends and splits applied), rounded to four decimals, retrieved with `tools/fetch_data.py`. The fetch time is in `reference/data/fetch-log.txt`.
- The first row, 2022-12-31, is a base price only. Return months run from 2023-01 to 2026-09, 45 months in all.
- The four assets stand for: SPY US stocks, TLT US long-term Treasury bonds, GLD gold, USO oil.

## 2. Monthly return

Simple return: price this month end divided by price last month end, minus one. Not log returns. Computed per asset from adjusted close.

## 3. The house portfolio

Equal weight, 25 percent in each of the four assets, rebalanced back to equal weight at every month end. Its monthly return is therefore the plain average of the four assets' monthly returns in that month.

Buy and hold is a different portfolio and not the house portfolio: 25 percent in each asset bought at the 2022-12-31 prices and never rebalanced. When a question says "the portfolio" without qualification it means the house portfolio.

## 4. Calendar-year total return

Compound the twelve monthly returns of that year: multiply (1 + each monthly return), subtract one. Only 2023, 2024 and 2025 are complete years. 2026 runs January to September only and is reported as year to date, never as a calendar-year return.

## 5. Cumulative return over a period

Multiply (1 + each monthly return) across the period, subtract one. "The full period" means 2023-01 to 2026-09.

## 6. Annualised volatility

Sample standard deviation of the monthly returns (divide by n minus 1) multiplied by the square root of 12.

For the Sharpe ratio, annualised return is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns multiplied by 12, the risk-free rate is zero, and Sharpe is annualised return divided by annualised volatility. This is a stated simplification, not a claim about the right risk-free rate.

## 7. Maximum drawdown

Build the cumulative index: start at 1.00 on 2022-12-31 and multiply by (1 + monthly return) each month. Drawdown in a month is the index divided by its running peak, minus one. Maximum drawdown is the most negative drawdown; the trough month is the month in which it occurs.

## 8. Correlation

Pearson correlation of monthly returns over the stated period. Never of price levels. Correlating price levels is the common mistake this section exists to stop.

## 9. Best and worst month

The largest and smallest monthly return in the stated period, for an asset or for the house portfolio.

## 10. Rounding and format

Returns, volatility and drawdowns in percent to one decimal. Sharpe ratios and correlations to two decimals. Months as YYYY-MM.

## 11. Outside the dataset

Any month before 2023-01 or after 2026-09 is not in the dataset. The answer is "not in the dataset; the data ends 2026-09-30", with no number, no estimate, and no figure from memory.

## 12. What this file never does

It never holds a computed answer. Answers come from the data through these rules at the moment they are asked.

BEST 2026-03 8.8%
```

The best month was **March 2026 (2026-03)**, when the portfolio returned **+8.8%**.

I worked this out from the month-end price file. The portfolio's return each month is the plain average of the four funds' simple monthly returns (methodology section 3), and the best month is the largest of those (section 9). I used the price rows from 2025-12-31 to 2026-09-30 because December 2025 is the starting price for January's return.

```python
rows=list(csv.DictReader(open('reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv')))
for p,c in zip(rows,rows[1:]):   # 2026 rows only
    r={k:float(c[k])/float(p[k])-1 for k in ['SPY','TLT','GLD','USO']}
    pr=sum(r.values())/4
```

```
2026-01  7.17%   2026-04  5.93%   2026-07  4.44%

2026-03  8.76%   2026-06 -7.27%   2026-09 -0.88%
```

That month was almost entirely oil. USO (oil) rose 55.3%, while SPY (stocks) fell 4.9%, TLT (long-term Treasury bonds) fell 4.2% and GLD (gold) fell 11.1%. January was second at +7.2%.

# Four-asset desk: the map

Instructions, not state. Read this first, every time, then go where the table sends you.

One sentence: this folder answers numeric questions about four ETFs, SPY, TLT, GLD and USO, and the equal-weight portfolio of the four, from one month-end price file under one written methodology, and says plainly when the data does not cover the question.

## What is this, what do I do next, where does the information come from, what breaks it?

- What: a desk that turns a plain question into one checkable number with its method and its rows.
- Next: for a numeric question, read `rules.md`, then the one methodology section named in the table below, then compute from the price file. Open nothing else unless the route table sends you there.
- Information: only `reference/`. The price file holds the prices, the data dictionary says what the columns are, the methodology holds every convention. Nothing comes from memory of markets.
- Breaks: months outside the window the methodology defines, assets not in the file, anything needing daily prices, and any request for a forecast or advice.

## Where things live

| Path | What it holds | Kind |
|------|---------------|------|
| `identity.md` | the job, who asks, what goes out, what breaks it | instructions |
| `rules.md` | numbered pass conditions and the exact shape of the answer line | instructions |
| `examples.md` | two right answers and one wrong one, with why | instructions |
| `reference/methodology.md` | every convention, one section per quantity; the one home for every fact | state |
| `reference/data/data-dictionary.md` | columns, source, coverage of the price file | state |
| `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` | month-end adjusted closes, SPY TLT GLD USO | state |

## Route by what was asked

| If the question asks for | Read | Do not open | Then stop at |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|--------------|
| a return, volatility, Sharpe, drawdown, correlation, best or worst month, for an asset or the equal-weight portfolio | `rules.md`, the one methodology section from the table below, the price file | `identity.md`, `examples.md`, the data dictionary, the fetch log | the ANSWER line |
| a month before or after the data window | `reference/methodology.md` section 11 | everything else | a refusal with the reason, no number |
| an asset not in the file, daily data, a forecast, or what to buy | `identity.md`, last section | everything else | a one-line decline |
| how an answer should look, when rule 9 is not enough | `examples.md` | everything else | the matching example |

Reading the whole folder is not wrong, but it is not the job. Each file is written so that a question needs at most three of them.

## Which methodology section

| Quantity | Section | Quantity | Section |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| what the file is, the window | 1 | annualised volatility, Sharpe | 6 |
| monthly return | 2 | maximum drawdown | 7 |
| the equal-weight portfolio | 3 | correlation | 8 |
| calendar-year return | 4 | best and worst month | 9 |
| cumulative return | 5 | rounding; outside the data | 10; 11 |

## The one rule

Every number comes from code run on the price file, under the methodology, and the answer line names the section and the rows. No number from memory, ever.

## Size

Roughly, in tokens: this map 550, identity 350, rules 550, examples 750, methodology 800, data dictionary 300, price file 1,000. Map plus rules plus one question's inputs lands near 3,000.

# Methodology: how the desk computes every number

State, not instructions. This is the one home for every convention. Load it before answering any question that involves a number, and name the section you used.

## 1. What the dataset is

- File: `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv`. Columns: `Date`, `SPY`, `TLT`, `GLD`, `USO`.
- `Date` is the calendar month end. The price on that row is the adjusted close of the last trading day in that month.
- Prices are Yahoo Finance adjusted closes (dividends and splits applied), rounded to four decimals, retrieved with `tools/fetch_data.py`. The fetch time is in `reference/data/fetch-log.txt`.
- The first row, 2022-12-31, is a base price only. Return months run from 2023-01 to 2026-09, 45 months in all.
- The four assets stand for: SPY US stocks, TLT US long-term Treasury bonds, GLD gold, USO oil.

## 2. Monthly return

Simple return: price this month end divided by price last month end, minus one. Not log returns. Computed per asset from adjusted close.

## 3. The house portfolio

Equal weight, 25 percent in each of the four assets, rebalanced back to equal weight at every month end. Its monthly return is therefore the plain average of the four assets' monthly returns in that month.

Buy and hold is a different portfolio and not the house portfolio: 25 percent in each asset bought at the 2022-12-31 prices and never rebalanced. When a question says "the portfolio" without qualification it means the house portfolio.

## 4. Calendar-year total return

Compound the twelve monthly returns of that year: multiply (1 + each monthly return), subtract one. Only 2023, 2024 and 2025 are complete years. 2026 runs January to September only and is reported as year to date, never as a calendar-year return.

## 5. Cumulative return over a period

Multiply (1 + each monthly return) across the period, subtract one. "The full period" means 2023-01 to 2026-09.

## 6. Annualised volatility

Sample standard deviation of the monthly returns (divide by n minus 1) multiplied by the square root of 12.

For the Sharpe ratio, annualised return is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns multiplied by 12, the risk-free rate is zero, and Sharpe is annualised return divided by annualised volatility. This is a stated simplification, not a claim about the right risk-free rate.

## 7. Maximum drawdown

Build the cumulative index: start at 1.00 on 2022-12-31 and multiply by (1 + monthly return) each month. Drawdown in a month is the index divided by its running peak, minus one. Maximum drawdown is the most negative drawdown; the trough month is the month in which it occurs.

## 8. Correlation

Pearson correlation of monthly returns over the stated period. Never of price levels. Correlating price levels is the common mistake this section exists to stop.

## 9. Best and worst month

The largest and smallest monthly return in the stated period, for an asset or for the house portfolio.

## 10. Rounding and format

Returns, volatility and drawdowns in percent to one decimal. Sharpe ratios and correlations to two decimals. Months as YYYY-MM.

## 11. Outside the dataset

Any month before 2023-01 or after 2026-09 is not in the dataset. The answer is "not in the dataset; the data ends 2026-09-30", with no number, no estimate, and no figure from memory.

## 12. What this file never does

It never holds a computed answer. Answers come from the data through these rules at the moment they are asked.
# Rules: pass conditions for every answer

Instructions, not state. Load after `identity.md`, before computing anything. Each rule is stated once. The conventions they point to live in `reference/methodology.md` and are not repeated here.

## What must be true of every number?

1. It was computed by code that reads `reference/data/monthly-adjusted-close.csv` directly, or rows copied from it verbatim. Never retype a price from memory, and never type a result from memory.
2. It follows the methodology section for that quantity. The README's section table says which one. The section number appears in the answer line.
3. Its inputs are stated: the columns used and the first and last row dates used.
4. It is rounded as methodology section 10 says, with its unit.

## What if the question sets its own terms?

5. If the question names a period, a weighting or a rebalancing rule, use exactly that. If it is silent, use the methodology's default and write "methodology default" in the working.
6. If the question asks for a quantity the methodology does not define, say so, define it in one sentence before computing, and write "ad hoc" in place of the section number.

## What if the data does not cover it?

7. Any month outside the window in methodology section 1 is answered per section 11: no number, no estimate, no figure from memory. A month after the window is refused exactly like a month before it.
8. Any asset not in the file, or any question that needs daily data, gets a one-line decline that says what the file does hold.

## What shape does the answer take?

9. Working first, short. Then the code and its printed result. Then one final line, exactly in this shape:

   `ANSWER: <value with unit> | METHOD: methodology section <n> | SOURCE: monthly-adjusted-close.csv, <columns>, rows <first date> to <last date>`

   For a refusal: `ANSWER: not in the dataset | METHOD: methodology section 11 | SOURCE: none`

10. Prose outside the code and the answer line stays under 120 words. The client wants the number, not an essay.

## What does this desk never do?

11. Never fetch live prices, search the web, or use memory of market history. Never recommend buying, selling or holding anything. Never paste a key, a token or a password into a chat.
2026-05-31,752.6671,84.1059,417.12,129.09
2026-06-30,744.9202,85.0865,368.38,106.44

2026-09-30,762.63,77.468,380.84,145.66
```

I can't give a figure for October 2026 because the price file stops at 2026-09-30. The last row in `monthly-adjusted-close.csv` is 2026-09-30. Section 11 of the methodology says any month after 2026-09 is outside the dataset, so the answer has no number, no estimate and no figure from memory.

October 2026 also isn't over yet: today is 2026-10-13, so there is no October month-end price for any of the four ETFs. The return can be calculated once the file has a 2026-10-31 row.

ANSWER: not in the dataset | METHOD: methodology section 11 | SOURCE: none
